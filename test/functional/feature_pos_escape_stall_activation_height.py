"""The escaping-stall MTP rule must apply ONLY from its activation height.

Why the gate exists. The parent-chain median-time-past requirement for
sub-quorum (escaping-stall) blocks was added in response to the 2026-07-17
finality partition — after the testnet chain had already produced blocks that do
not satisfy it. Enforced from genesis, those blocks became unvalidatable: a node
syncing from scratch stopped at testnet block 1757 for ever and could never join
the network, while already-running nodes survived only because a block already in
the chainstate is never revalidated. That makes their state unreproducible: a
-reindex, a restore from backup or a disk failure and they cannot start again.

Gating the rule by height is the standard soft-fork treatment. This test pins
both sides of that boundary, because a gate that is silently ineffective in
either direction is worse than no gate: too low and the chain stays unsyncable,
too high and a real consensus rule is quietly not enforced.

  below the gate  a sub-quorum block WITHOUT the parent-chain time gap is
                  ACCEPTED (this is the history that already exists)
  at/above it     the same block is REJECTED with bad-pos-escape-stall-too-soon

The rule is also checked to be genuinely OFF at gate 0, which is the convention
shared with pos_exprace_height: 0 = not gated, a positive H = enforced from H.
A chain launched with the rule in place uses 1, never 0 (CONTRIBUTING.md).

The gate lives inside CheckEscapingStallMtpGap (anchor.cpp) rather than at its
call sites, so that a future call site cannot omit it and re-apply the rule
retroactively. This test drives it through real block production, so it covers
the function wherever it is reached from.

Topology mirrors feature_pos_autonomous_escaping_stall.py: node0 = parent
("Bitcoin"); node1 = the founder PoS node (sole genesis staker, sub-quorum by
construction); node2 = a non-staking peer providing gossip connectivity.
