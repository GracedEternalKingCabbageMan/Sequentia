"""The one-time UTXO-set rewrite: Consensus::UtxoRecovery.

On 2026-07-29 a watchdog deleted the Sequentia testnet's founder treasury
wallet, and two of its outputs became unspendable for ever -- the private keys
and the wallet's master blinding key were both destroyed. The owner authorised
recovering them by consensus rule: at one agreed height, every node retires those
two outpoints from its UTXO set and adds two replacements. The real table lives
in CTestNetParams and is pinned by sequentia_chainparams_tests; what CANNOT be
pinned by a unit test is the machinery, because that only shows itself over a
chain that is built, reorged, and rebuilt.

So this drives the same code path over a custom chain, whose recovery table comes
from -con_utxo_recovery_* instead of being hard-coded. Nothing here is
recovery-specific except the table: ConnectBlock, DisconnectBlock and the undo
records are the ones the testnet will run.

What it proves, in order:
  1. one block early, nothing has happened;
  2. at the activation height the retired coins are gone and the created ones
     exist, with exactly the asset, amount and scriptPubKey asked for;
  3. disconnecting that block restores the UTXO set byte for byte, and
     reconnecting it re-applies the rewrite -- so a reorg neither loses it nor
     applies it twice;
  4. a -reindex from genesis reaches an identical UTXO set, which is the property
     most easily got wrong: the rewrite has to be part of connecting a block, not
     something done once to a live chainstate;
  5. a chain WITHOUT the table replays the very same blocks and does NOT rewrite
     anything -- the gate is load-bearing, and a fresh chain (regtest as shipped,
     a future testnet, mainnet) inherits nobody's accident;
  6. a recovered output then spends with an ordinary signature, with no special
     case anywhere in the spend path.
